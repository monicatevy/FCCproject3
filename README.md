Build a Landing Page

My first attempt was to recreate a website of a brand that I like (Bodia Cambodian Apothecary) but I changed my mind because I couldn't find enough high quality pictures and also because it was a bit complicated compared to what FreeCodeCamp asked for the project. I've chosen to build my landing page on Albert-Kahn Garden and Museum, a place that visited in Paris.

**What I learnt :**
- [x] flexbox
- [x] position (relative, absolute, fixed), index-z
- [x] navbar (fixed, sticky)
- [x] slideshow gallery (+ crop images)
- [x] how to use fontawesome
- [x] file paths
- [x] button scroll to top (css only)
- [ ] media queries, adapt on different devices (work on progress)

I've edited the video by myself from a video that I found on Youtube.
